/**
 * toast-context.ts
 *
 * Toast context object + hook, kept separate from the provider component so
 * Fast Refresh works when editing the provider (same split as
 * `wallet-context.ts` / `WalletProvider.tsx`).
 *
 * A toast follows a transaction through its lifecycle:
 *
 *   building → signing → confirmed / failed
 *
 * `building` is the build + simulate call, `signing` is the wallet prompt, and
 * the terminal stages are the submitted transaction or the error the caller
 * would otherwise only see inline. Feedback used to be inline only, so it was
 * easy to miss after navigation (issue #60).
